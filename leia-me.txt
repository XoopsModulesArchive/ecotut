2!,

Thanks for taking the time to download and try WF-ECB ecoTut, 
hope that you enjoy using this module and you find a use for it.

WF-ECB ecoTut is an Question-Answer and Tutor module (FAQ-Tut => Tut) 
where you can give your users information to frequently asked questions, 
or give a complete Instruction about many subjects like informatics, 
how to make a cake >_< ...All in one area.

This modul based on WF-FAQ, I rebuild this module for my purpose 
: in my shool, we have many departments 
:informatics, Math, Physics...What happend if each department want to post their own FAQ, 
Tutor in one area like FAQ module? 
So I re-arrange and add new ability for this modul
: Supercategory
[for Departments] -> Category 
[each have one editor] -> topic 
[just editor can post and edit, remove...]

Nearly all the previous code to that module has gone and been replaced 
with my own now and now this module makes use of many 

Xoops core functions.

How to install

WF-ECB ecoTut should be treated like any other Xoops module and should be installed 
exactly the same way -> easy if you are a xooper :-D
